# AllTheMaps
AllTheMaps is a family of map extensions for the game Ark: Survival Evolved which implements all the dinos and strategic resources available in the game to every map individually.

This allows for people running single player worlds or dedicated servers with friends to acess content from other maps without the need for clusters / transferring between maps
